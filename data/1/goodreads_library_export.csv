While I believe myself to be more of an introverted nature, I couldn't relate to some of the traits that she described for introverts while could find some of the extrovert traits holding true. For eg - the book generalizes that introverts prefer to meet people in friendly contexts while extroverts prefer people who they compete with which in my mind is a very broad generalization and doesn't hold true universally for anyone. I don't believe the two groups to be as distinct as something like men and women but in my experience, introversion extroversion is more of a spectrum than two distinct points and you would find most of the people lying somewhere in the middle rather than to the extremes. <br/><br/>However, some of the coping mechanisms suggested in the book like self-monitoring, pretend extroversion, and Free Trait agreement (acting out of character some of the time in exchange for being ourselves the rest of the time) can really help both introverts and extroverts to cope with the outside world while being true to their inner selves most of the time ",,,1,0
